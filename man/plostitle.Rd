\title{Search PLoS Journals titles.}
\usage{
plostitle(q = NULL, fl = "id", fq = NULL, sort = NULL, start = 0,
  limit = 10, key = NULL, sleep = 6, callopts = list(), terms = NULL,
  fields = NULL, toquery = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Search terms (character). You can search on specific fields by
doing 'field:your query'. For example, a real query on a specific field would
be 'author:Smith'.}

\item{fl}{Fields to return from search (character) [e.g., 'id,title'],
any combination of search fields [type 'data(plosfields)', then
'plosfields'].}

\item{fq}{List specific fields to filter the query on (if NA, all queried).
The options for this parameter are the same as those for the fl parameter.
Note that using this parameter doesn't influence the actual query, but is used
to filter the resuls to a subset of those you want returned. For example,
if you want full articles only, you can do 'doc_type:full'. In another example,
if you want only results from the journal PLOS One, you can do
'cross_published_journal_key:PLoSONE'. See journalnamekey() for journal
abbreviations.}

\item{sort}{Sort results according to a particular field, and specify ascending (asc)
or descending (desc) after a space; see examples. For example, to sort the
counter_total_all field in descending fashion, do sort='counter_total_all desc'}

\item{start}{Record to start at (used in combination with limit when
you need to cycle through more results than the max allowed=1000)}

\item{limit}{Number of results to return (integer)}

\item{key}{Your PLoS API key, either enter as the key, or loads from .Rprofile.
See details.}

\item{sleep}{Number of seconds to wait between requests. No need to use this for
a single call to searchplos. However, if you are using searchplos in a loop or
lapply type call, do sleep parameter is used to prevent your IP address from being
blocked. You can only do 10 requests per minute, so one request every 6 seconds is
about right.}

\item{callopts}{Optional additional curl options (debugging tools mostly)}

\item{terms}{DEPRECATED PARAMETER - replaced with the q param.}

\item{fields}{DEPRECATED PARAMETER - replaced with the fl param.}

\item{toquery}{DEPRECATED PARAMETER - replaced with the fq param.}
}
\value{
Titles, in addition to any other fields requested in a data.frame.

Search PLoS Journals titles.

\details{
Get a PLOS API key at \url{http://alm.plos.org/}. Note that the API key you recieve
at that URL works for the PLOS ALM (article-level metrics) API as well. See the
alm package \url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/alm/index.html} to
access PLOS ALM data.

You can store your PLOS Search API key in your .Rprofile file so that you don't
have to enter the key each function call. Open up your .Rprofile file on your
computer, and put it an entry like:

options(PlosApiKey = "your plos api key")
